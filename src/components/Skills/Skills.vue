                        I have been falling in love with both the front and the
                        backend for the past two years now. I am currently
                        working at
                        <a href="https://www.wheelhub.es/" target="blank"
                          >Wheelhub Apps
                        </a>
                        am honored happy to be a part of their team. Every day I
                        learn something new and I am lucky enough to be
                        surrounded by amazing collegues.
                        <br />
                        I also try to help out at the

                        workshops for the last year or so. I participate as a
                        coach at their workshops and am now part of a team
                        trying to develop a pairing tool we can use in the
                        workshops. But that's not all I've done so, what do web
                        developing, waitressing, journalism and the fashion
                        industry have in common? Me. I am not just a developer.
                        I am many more things. Some of them are good, some bad,
                        some greatâ€¦ if you want to know more you can check out
                        my different projects, certificates, etc or just drop me
                        a line on my contact form!

                    Codebar is a project born out of the necessity to give
                    minorities a chance at equal opportunities. The idea is to
                    bring students and coaches together and the coaches help the
                    students with a project of their choice or in one of the
